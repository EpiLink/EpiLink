      description: |
        This endpoint uses the provided ID Provider authorization code to record the e-mail address of the account in
        the database. Note that the ID Provider account retrieved via the authorization code must be the one that was
        used for creating the account in the first place -- otherwise, the operation fails with a 112 error code.

        Note that the back-end will always consume the authorization code, although it will discard the retrieved token
        immediately in case of an error (e.g. identity already known).

        Triggers a global role update for the user on success.

        In order to complete the submission procedure, two authorization codes must be provided:

        You basically have to do the first part of the authorization code flow. The URL to use to acquire the
        authorization code is provided in `GET /meta/info`.

        Check the EpiLink documentation for more information on the procedure.
