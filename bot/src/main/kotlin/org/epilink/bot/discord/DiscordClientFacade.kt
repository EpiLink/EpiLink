 * operations, the operations of this interface *must not be blocking*, only suspending. They should suspend until the
 * operation has been successfully processed by Discord.
 *
 * Because the bot may have joined guilds it does not have configurations for, the bot has a concept of monitored
 * guilds.
 *
 * - Guilds in which the bot is connected and has configurations for are said to be **monitored**.
 * - Guilds in which the bot is connected but does *not* have configurations for are said to be **unmonitored**.
 * - Guilds in which the bot is not but has configurations for are said to be **orphaned**. Not currently checked.
